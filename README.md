# Tic Tac Toe CLI

A simple CLI implementation of the widely known children's game Tic Tac Toe
written in Go.

---

The goal of this project is not to implement the most elegant or most performant
or most feature rich CLI version of the game. It is my *first* actual program
written in the Go programming language. The project's sole purpose is for me to
get some initial hands on experience and feel for the language after learning
its syntax and concepts. So far, I quite like it and I will try to build up
from here to more and more advanced projects using the language.
